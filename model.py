# Multi-way partitioning problem is to partition a set of integers into k disjoint subsets 
# so that the sum of the numbers in each subset are as nearly equal as possible.

# We want to distribute populations of blocks to existing facilities as nearly as possible. 
# To do that, we partition the set of blocks into k many set of blocks such that 
# total populations of sets are as nearly equal as possible. k: number of existing facilities.

# We model an integer programming to solve this problem, and find an exact solution by pulp library.
